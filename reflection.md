Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    The overall code seem to be more organized with appropriate encapsulation, add there is reduced or no risk of unwanted modification of data even if there are multiple classes with multiple attributes and methods that interact actively. Intended modification of values become more straightforward too.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I was able to build mostly appropriate relationship of classes and understand the point of encapsulation. I didn't test my code until after I wrote all of them but testing as I go might have been more effective. This assignment included a lot of methods that modified and returned values without printing them so it was a bit harder to identify which part exactly is not working as I intended.
